Android App for listing the most Popular Tv Shows using The Moive DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)  
This simple app is divided in two sections:
* <b>Tv Shows List</b> 
  This is the first screen when the app is launched. On this screen we have a list of Tv Shows displayed with big poster image along with the Tv Show title and average rating.
* <b>Tv Show Details</b> After selecting item from the Tv Shows List we open a new screen where we display more information about the selected Tv Show along with a Horizontal list of Similar Tv Shows.
